I made an airline booking system in Java. This allowed me to become comortable with the formatting and syntax of Java
This program allows you to book and check airline reservations using files.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to code all of this.

This is strictly in Java and I needed the 3 Java libraries. (io, filewriter, scanner)
